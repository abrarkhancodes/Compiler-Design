# Compiler Design Programs

This repository contains compiler design lab programs including Lex, Yacc, and C implementations.


Program1.l	Identifies valid identifiers in input.	
Program2.l	Recognizes C keywords.	
Program3.l	Classifies operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment).	
Program4.l	Identifies constants, comments, identifiers, and operators in C.	
Program5.l	Distinguishes vowels and consonants.	
Program6.l	Identifies functions and comments in C.	
Program7.c	Top-Down parsing using backtracking (brute force) method for a given grammar.
Program8.c	Recursive descent parser with lookahead for arithmetic expressions.	
Program9.c	Recursive descent parser with lookahead for parsing expressions with lists and parentheses.	
Program10.c	Computes FIRST sets for each non-terminal in a grammar.	
Program11.l	Counts the number of words and lines in a given file or program.	
Program12.y	Yacc calculator that evaluates arithmetic expressions with addition and multiplication (includes built-in yylex function).	
Program13	Yacc calculator with separate Lex file (Program13.l and Program13.y) for evaluating arithmetic expressions with addition and multiplication.	
Program14	YACC top-down parser with Lex file (Program14.l and Program14.y) for validating arithmetic expressions using grammar after eliminating left recursion.	
Program15.c	Lexical analyzer implementation in C that reads from a file and identifies keywords, identifiers, operators, and numbers.	
Program16.c	Computes FOLLOW sets for non-terminals in a grammar. The FOLLOW set contains terminal symbols that can appear immediately after a non-terminal.	
Program17.c	Implements stack allocation strategy for compilers, simulating activation record stack management for function calls and returns.	
2. Assignment-Programs

Program1.l	Assignment program for identifier recognition.	
Program2.l	Assignment program for recognizing various representations of real numbers in programming languages.
